# challenge5_calendar
This is the fifth challenge of the Columbia Univ Bootcamp for fullstack dev creating a calendar

## Project Description

This is my FIFTH challenge homework assignment for the BootCamp course titled "Module 5:  Third-Party APIs".  The following criteria were given to complete the challenge:

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours of 9am to 5pm
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
